This page contains posts and papers which discuss various topics related to compilers.
I continue to update this page as I find more interesting resources,
so some of the links can be gone if I find them irrelevant or outdated.
So, please make sure that save them if you find them interested.

## Courses

These are the courses that KAIST offer as an introduction to programming languages:

- https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-1
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages2

These lecture define a simple arithmetic language and grow it gradually to introduce concepts in PL world:
AST, scoping, type checking, type inference, polymorphism, and so on.
Taking this source is a must if you are going into a PL research, including compilers.

Gratefully, Cornell university offers lecture videos for free on the Internet.
This is their grad school course on compilers.
